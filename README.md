## Project Description:

### Objective:

The project aims to create a simple currency converter that utilizes an API to fetch current exchange rates.

### Feature Description:

- **Currency Conversion:** Allow users to input an amount in one currency and convert it to another using current exchange rates.
- **Currency Selection:** Provide a list of available currencies for users to choose from.
- **Rate Updates:** Automatically fetch the latest exchange rates from an external API.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Currency Conversion:** Interactive interface allowing users to input an amount, select source and target currencies, and then perform the conversion.
- **Currency Selection:** Dropdown list with available currencies for selection.
- **Rate Updates:** Automatic retrieval of the latest rates from an external API.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Security:** Secure management of user data and protection against attacks.
- **Responsiveness:** Interface adapted for different devices.
- **Usability:** Intuitive interface providing easy usage.

## Interface Design:

### Interface Sketches/Visualizations:

- *Amount input field*
- *Dropdowns for selecting source and target currencies*
- *Convert button*
- *Display of the conversion result*

### Site Map:

- *Homepage:* User interface with a form for entering data and currency conversion.

## System Architecture:

### Technologies:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (potentially using a framework, e.g., React).
- **Backend:** Node.js with the Express framework or another suitable language and framework.
- **Exchange Rates API:** Utilizing a public API providing current exchange rates.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of currency conversion functions.
- **Interface Tests:** Ensure the interface works correctly on different devices.
- **Security Tests:** Verify secure data management.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React for more advanced features).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (or another framework), a database (for storing user settings).
- **API:** Utilizing an available API for exchange rates.

### Code Structure:

- *Directories/Files:* Separate files for currency conversion logic, user interface, and data management.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Check the correctness of individual currency conversion functions.
- **User Interface Tests:** Check user interaction on different devices.
- **Security Tests:** Verify the system's resistance to intrusion attempts.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each currency conversion function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing discovered errors.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, corrections, publication on the production server.
- **Deadlines:** Determine dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels with users for issue reporting.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on needs and user feedback.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation Stages:** Breakdown of tasks into specific activities (e.g., interface design, function implementation, testing).
- **Deadlines:** Define the time required for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours worked or the development team's costs.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, external services, possible fees for technical support.
